# Car-Guess-Demo

## Car Guess Demo is an automotive guessing game where players discover a car
## by comparing technical characteristics, not images.

## This is an early alpha demo, focused on validating gameplay systems,
## data modeling, and user feedback.

## 🎯 Core Idea
	•	Guess the car by selecting brand and model
	•	Intelligent car search system (brand + model validation)
	•	Compare technical categories (engine, traction, fuel, etc.)
	•	Receive visual feedback (correct, close, wrong)
	•	Learn automotive specs while playing

## 🚗 Current Data
	•	61+ cars implemented
	•	Structured by:
	•	Brand
	•	Model
	•	Generation
	•	Trim/version abstraction
	•	Designed for scalability (easy to add new cars and brands)

## 🧠 Systems Implemented
	•	Smart car search (brand/model aware)
	•	Technical comparison logic
	•	Category-based feedback system
	•	Internal version abstraction (avoids data duplication)

## 🚧 Project Status
	•	Early Alpha
	•	Web-based demo
	•	Core systems functional
	•	Data and features expanded weekly

## 📣 Feedback

This project evolves with community input.
Tester feedback directly influences:
	•	Gameplay balance
	•	Comparison logic
	•	Data depth

# More updates coming soon.
