## 🚗 Car Guess Demo

Car Guess Demo is an automotive guessing game where players discover a car
by comparing technical characteristics instead of images.

## No visuals. No hints. Just logic, specs and reasoning.

This is an early alpha web demo, focused on validating gameplay mechanics
and evolving through real community feedback.

## 🎯 Core Idea

    •	Guess the car by selecting brand and model
    •	Compare technical categories (engine, drivetrain, year, class, etc.)
    •	Receive instant visual feedback:
    •	✅ correct
    •	🟡 close
    •	❌ wrong
    •	Learn about cars while playing

The goal is not speed — it’s understanding.
